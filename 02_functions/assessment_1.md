## Battle Robot

Implement module which provides API to control Battle Robot!

Lets assume that you have a Map 100x100.

Following commands should be supported:
- step forward (should return new robot coordinates)
- turn left, right and around (should return new direction)
- fire (should return number of ammunition)

Coordinates, direction and ammo shouldn't be available from outside the module.
