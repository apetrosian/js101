# Callbacks

**Callbacks** are functions that you pass as arguments to be invoked when the callee has finished its job.

Callbacks are commonly passed into **event handlers**, **Ajax requests**, and **timers**.

Callbacks work great when you're only waiting for one operation at a time, or when you only have one job to do when the response comes back.
